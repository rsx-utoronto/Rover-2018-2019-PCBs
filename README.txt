PCB Repo:

1. Ensure when working, the forward / back annotation is allowed. (A bar in black and yellow stripes will appear at the top of the window if the annotation has broken)
2. Do not have two people working on a board at the same time - merging is hard. (At least until we figure out how to merge nicely)
